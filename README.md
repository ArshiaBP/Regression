# Regression

This project demonstrates various types of regression techniques, including:

1. Linear Regression (Ordinary Least Squares)
2. Ridge Regression (L2 Regularization)
3. Lasso Regression (L1 Regularization)
4. ElasticNet (Combination of L1 and L2 Regularization)

Each of these models has its own strengths and weaknesses, and the project provides a hands-on example of how to use them for predictive modeling tasks. Regularization is introduced in the Ridge, Lasso, and ElasticNet models to control overfitting, making them particularly useful for datasets with multicollinearity or high-dimensionality.
